I've analyzed the plan and created a detailed status table. Here's what I found:

## Summary

**All target files verified:**
- `iznik-nuxt3/components/PostItem.vue` - Has `maxlength="60"` at line 9 (reference implementation)
- `iznik-nuxt3/pages/give/mobile/details.vue` - EXISTS, needs maxlength
- `iznik-nuxt3/pages/find/mobile/details.vue` - EXISTS, needs maxlength  
- `iznik-nuxt3-modtools/modtools/components/ModStdMessageModal.vue` - EXISTS, needs maxlength
- `iznik-server` - Needs backend validation

**Git status:** All repositories are clean (no uncommitted changes)

**Task breakdown:** 6 discrete tasks identified:
1. Add maxlength to give/mobile/details.vue
2. Add maxlength to find/mobile/details.vue
3. Add maxlength to ModStdMessageModal.vue
4. Add backend validation in iznik-server
5. Test frontend changes
6. Test backend validation

**Plan file created:** `plans/in-progress/item-name-length-limit.md`

--- Iteration 5 Output ---
All implementations are verified and in place:

1. ✅ **Mobile Give Details** (`pages/give/mobile/details.vue`): Has `maxlength="60"`
2. ✅ **Mobile Find Details** (`pages/find/mobile/details.vue`): Has `maxlength="60"`
3. ✅ **ModStdMessageModal** (`modtools/components/ModStdMessageModal.vue`): Has `maxlength="60"`
4. ✅ **Backend Item.php**: Has `MAX_ITEM_NAME_LENGTH = 60` constant and truncation logic

The implementation is complete. CI pipeline 1066 is running. Since the CI is running and we cannot complete the plan until CI passes, I need to indicate that we're waiting for CI.

**Summary of Iteration 5:**
- Verified all implementation work is complete and committed
- All 4 locations now have the 60 character limit enforced:
  - Frontend: 3 input fields have `maxlength="60"`
  - Backend: `Item.php` truncates names to 60 characters
- CI pipeline 1066 (job 1222) is currently running - started at 17:45 UTC
- Plan status updated to reflect current CI run
- Cannot mark plan complete until CI passes

The plan cannot be marked complete until CI passes. The next iteration should check CI status and mark complete if successful.
