# Revised Recommendations: Single Third-Party Tool Approach

## Executive Summary

**Constraint**: Maximum one third-party tool (excluding AI APIs like OpenAI/Anthropic)

**Revised Recommendation**: Choose **Mautic** as the single third-party platform, with everything else built custom in Laravel. This provides the most comprehensive capabilities while respecting the constraint.

## Three Single-Tool Options

### Option A: Mautic Only (Recommended)
**Single Tool**: Mautic (free, GPL license)
**Custom Build**: Laravel integration layer, bandit testing, RFM segmentation

**Why Mautic**:
- ✅ **Comprehensive platform**: Email sending, automation, segmentation, analytics
- ✅ **Multi-channel support**: Email, SMS, social media, web notifications
- ✅ **Free and open source**: No licensing costs
- ✅ **API-driven**: Excellent integration capabilities
- ✅ **Self-hosted**: Full data control

### Option B: PostHog Only
**Single Tool**: PostHog (free self-hosted)
**Custom Build**: Laravel email sending, template system, automation

**Limitations**:
- ❌ **No email sending capabilities**: Only basic beta messaging
- ❌ **Missing email templates**: Would need complete custom solution
- ❌ **No email automation**: Requires building drip campaigns from scratch

### Option C: Mailcoach Only
**Single Tool**: Mailcoach (€999/year)
**Custom Build**: Analytics, experimentation, bandit testing

**Limitations**:
- ❌ **Commercial license required**: Annual cost
- ❌ **Email-only focus**: No multi-channel capabilities
- ❌ **Limited analytics**: Would need extensive custom tracking

## Recommended Architecture: Mautic + Laravel

## Experiment Journey: User Click → Optimization

### Scenario: Weekly Digest Email Optimization

#### 1. **Experiment Setup** (Laravel Service)
```
AI generates 5 subject line variants for "champions" RFM segment:
• "Your weekly Freegle roundup 🌱"
• "5 new items near you this week"
• "Help needed: items looking for homes"
• "Your impact: 12 items saved from landfill"
• "Community spotlight: amazing stories"

Thompson Sampling algorithm allocates:
• Variant A: 40% traffic
• Variant B: 20% traffic
• Variant C: 15% traffic
• Variant D: 15% traffic
• Variant E: 10% traffic
```

#### 2. **Email Creation** (Mautic)
```php
// Laravel sends variants to Mautic via API
foreach ($variants as $variant) {
    $mautic->emails()->create([
        'name' => "Digest Week 42 - Variant {$variant['id']}",
        'subject' => $variant['subject'],
        'customHtml' => $renderedTemplate,
        'lists' => [$championSegmentId],
        'publishUp' => now(),
    ]);
}
```

#### 3. **User Receives Email** (Mautic → User)
```
John (Champion segment) receives:
Subject: "Your impact: 12 items saved from landfill"
Tracking pixel: https://track.freegle.com/beacon/abc123
Click tracking: All links wrapped with tracking URLs
```

#### 4. **User Interaction** (Tracked Events)
```
09:15 - Email delivered (Mautic webhook → Laravel)
09:17 - Email opened (tracking pixel → Laravel)
09:18 - Clicked "Browse new items" (Mautic → Laravel)
09:22 - Viewed 3 items on website (Freegle → Laravel)
09:25 - Contacted item owner (Freegle → Laravel)
```

#### 5. **Real-time Analysis** (Laravel Service)
```php
// Event processing
$events = [
    'email_opened' => ['timestamp' => '09:17', 'variant' => 'D'],
    'email_clicked' => ['timestamp' => '09:18', 'variant' => 'D'],
    'items_viewed' => ['timestamp' => '09:22', 'count' => 3],
    'contact_made' => ['timestamp' => '09:25', 'value' => 10]
];

// Update bandit algorithm
$banditEngine->updateVariantPerformance('D', $events);
```

#### 6. **Algorithm Learning** (Thompson Sampling)
```
Variant D performance update:
• Open rate: 45% (+5% vs baseline)
• Click rate: 32% (+8% vs baseline)
• Conversion rate: 12% (+3% vs baseline)
• Engagement score: 8.2/10

New traffic allocation:
• Variant D: 60% traffic (increased)
• Variant A: 25% traffic (decreased)
• Variant B: 10% traffic (decreased)
• Variants C,E: 2.5% each (minimal testing)
```

#### 7. **Next Week Optimization** (AI + Learning)
```php
// AI generates new variants based on winning patterns
$prompt = "Generate email subject variants based on successful pattern:
'Your impact: 12 items saved from landfill' performed well.
Focus on: personal impact, specific numbers, environmental benefit.
Audience: highly engaged community champions.";

$newVariants = OpenAI::generate($prompt);
// Results: 5 new variants emphasizing impact and specific metrics
```

#### 8. **Long-term Optimization** (RFM Evolution)
```
User Journey Progression:
John's engagement increased 25% → Moved from "Champion" to "Super Champion"
Trigger: Different email frequency and content strategy
Next: Invitation to volunteer as moderator

Algorithm Insights:
• Impact-focused subjects work best for Champions
• Environmental messaging drives 15% higher engagement
• Specific numbers (items saved) increase click rates
• Morning delivery (9am) optimal for this segment
```

#### 9. **Cross-Channel Learning** (Future Enhancement)
```
Email insights applied to other channels:
• Push notifications: Use impact-focused messaging
• In-app messages: Highlight specific environmental benefits
• ModTools alerts: Emphasize community impact metrics

Unified optimization across all notification types.
```
