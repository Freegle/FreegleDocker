[2026-01-06 16:11:45] [INFO] Created temporary plan: /home/edward/FreegleDockerWSL/ralph/temp-plans/test-20260106-161145.md
[2026-01-06 16:11:45] [INFO] First run for this plan. Initializing state.
[2026-01-06 16:11:45] [INFO] Checking git status across all submodules...

[2026-01-06 16:11:45] [INFO] Running initializer agent to set up environment...
[2026-01-06 16:12:13] [SUCCESS] Initializer agent completed.
--- Initializer Output ---
The plan already has a status table in the correct format. The task is simply "test" which is quite vague - it appears to be a test of the ralph script system itself rather than a meaningful development task.

The status table is already properly set up with:

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | test | ⬜ Pending | |

The plan file already contains all the required elements:
- Task status table with proper format
- Description section
- Success criteria section

No modifications needed to the plan structure - it's ready for execution.

[2026-01-06 16:12:13] [INFO] ========== Starting iteration 1 of 10 ==========
[2026-01-06 16:12:13] [INFO] Running Claude with plan prompt...
[2026-01-06 16:12:57] [SUCCESS] Claude completed iteration 1.
[2026-01-06 16:12:57] [INFO] Claude output summary saved to progress file.
--- Iteration 1 Output ---
The ralph script system has been successfully validated:

**Summary of this iteration:**
- Confirmed working directory is `/home/edward/FreegleDockerWSL`
- Verified the ralph infrastructure is functioning correctly
- The system successfully:
  - Created the temporary plan file
  - Ran the initializer agent
  - Started the iteration loop
  - Allowed execution of the plan
- Marked the test task as complete

The ralph script system is working as expected. This was a validation test of the system itself, not a development task requiring code changes or actual tests to run.
