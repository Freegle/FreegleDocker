# V1 to V2 API Migration

## Task Status

This is the master tracking table for API migration. Each row is designed as a single Ralph task.

### Deferred (Send Emails)

These endpoints cannot be migrated until Go has email capability:

| Endpoint | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| /session | Password reset, verification emails |
| /user | Welcome, verification, password reset emails |
| /memberships | Group join notifications |
| /message | Outcome notifications, reply notifications |
| /chatmessages | Chat notifications |
| /communityevent | Event notifications |
| /volunteering | Volunteer opportunity notifications |
| /invitation | Invitation emails |
| /team | Team notifications |
| /group | Group update notifications |

## Overview

Migration from PHP v1 API to Go v2 API for Freegle (FD) and ModTools (MT).

### Key Statistics
- **FD API usage**: 70 unique endpoints, 235 total API calls
- **MT API usage**: 70 unique endpoints, 266 total API calls
- **FD-only endpoints**: 1 (/logs)
- **MT-only endpoints**: 22+ (mostly moderation)
- **Shared endpoints**: 201

### Strategy
- **Phase 0**: Non-email endpoints (current focus)
- **Phase 1**: FD email-dependent endpoints (after email solution)
- **Phase 2**: MT-specific endpoints
- **Phase 3**: Cleanup and retirement

## How to Use with Ralph

Run Ralph with a specific endpoint:
```bash
./ralph.sh -t "Migrate /address endpoint write operations to v2 API"
```

Each migration task should:
1. Analyse the v1 PHP implementation
2. Implement v2 Go handler with tests
3. Update FD client code to use v2
4. Update MT client code if applicable
5. Mark v1 as deprecated

---

## Migration Procedure

**IMPORTANT**: A migration is NOT complete until BOTH backend AND frontend changes are done.
Implementing only the Go backend is "Partial" - the v1 API is still being called until client code is updated.

### 1. Implement v2 Go API (Backend)
- Create handler in `iznik-server-go/{domain}/{domain}.go`
- Add route in `iznik-server-go/router/routes.go` with Swagger annotations
- Regenerate Swagger: `./generate-swagger.sh`
- Verify endpoint appears in Swagger UI at `/swagger/`
- Ensure proper error handling

### 2. Add Tests
- Add test functions to `iznik-server-go/test/{domain}_test.go`
- Test all HTTP methods and error cases
- Run: `docker exec freegle-apiv2 go test ./test/{domain}_test.go ./test/main_test.go ./test/testUtils.go -v`

### 3. Wait for CI Verification
- **CRITICAL**: Local tests passing is NOT sufficient.
- Push changes and wait for CircleCI pipeline to complete successfully.
- All four test suites must pass: Go, PHPUnit, Laravel, Playwright.
- Do NOT proceed until CI is green.

### 4. Wait for Live Deployment
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT update client code until v2 is deployed to production.
- After CI passes, the Go backend will be deployed automatically.
- Verify deployment by checking Swagger on production: `https://apiv2.ilovefreegle.org/swagger/`
- Confirm your new endpoint is visible in the live Swagger docs.
- Mark task status as ⏳ Waiting until deployment is confirmed.

### 5. Update FD Client Code (Frontend)
- Only after confirming live deployment (step 4).
- Update API wrapper in `iznik-nuxt3/api/{Domain}API.js`:
  - `$get('/endpoint')` → `$getv2('/endpoint')`
  - `$post('/endpoint')` → `$postv2('/endpoint')`
- This is when the migration actually takes effect for users.

### 6. Update MT Client Code (if applicable)
- Same process in `iznik-nuxt3-modtools/api/{Domain}API.js`

### 7. Mark v1 PHP as Deprecated
Add at top of function:
```php
// TODO: DEPRECATED - Migrated to v2 Go API
// Migrated: YYYY-MM-DD
// V2 endpoints: <list>
```

### 8. Update This Document
- Change status from ⬜ Pending to ✅ Complete ONLY when:
  - Backend is implemented and tested
  - CI has passed
  - Backend is deployed to production
  - Client code has been updated to use v2
  - v1 code is marked deprecated
- Add completion date

---

## Email Dependency Constraint

**CRITICAL**: Go v2 API cannot send emails. APIs that send emails must remain in PHP until:
1. Email sending capability is added to Go, OR
2. A separate email service is created that Go can call

---

## API Analysis

### FD-Only API Calls
- **/logs** (1 call) - `iznik-nuxt3/stores/misc.js:45`

### MT-Only API Calls (22+ endpoints)
Moderation actions, MT-specific chat operations, configuration management.

### Shared API Calls (Top endpoints)
- **/messages (fetchMessages)**: FD (3), MT (6)
- **/message (update)**: FD (3), MT (6)
- **/noticeboard (action)**: FD (4), MT (4)
- **/news/{id} (fetch)**: FD (3), MT (3)
- **/group (patch)**: FD (3), MT (3)

---

## Analysis Scripts

Scripts for analysing v1 API usage are in `plans/scripts/`:
- `analyze-all-api-calls.js` - jscodeshift transformer
- `run-parallel-api-analysis.sh` - Parallel analysis runner

To re-run analysis:
```bash
cd /home/edward/FreegleDockerWSL
./plans/scripts/run-parallel-api-analysis.sh
```
