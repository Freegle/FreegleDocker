[2026-01-06 16:08:17] [INFO] Created temporary plan: /home/edward/FreegleDockerWSL/ralph/temp-plans/migrate-authority-endpoint-to-v2-api-20260106-160817.md
[2026-01-06 16:08:17] [INFO] First run for this plan. Initializing state.
[2026-01-06 16:08:17] [INFO] Checking git status across all submodules...
[2026-01-06 16:08:17] [WARN] FreegleDocker has uncommitted changes.
[2026-01-06 16:08:17] [WARN] There are uncommitted changes. Claude will see these and can build on them.
[2026-01-06 16:08:17] [INFO] Running initializer agent to set up environment...
[2026-01-06 16:09:56] [SUCCESS] Initializer agent completed.
--- Initializer Output ---
The plan is already properly initialized with:

1. ✅ A detailed status table with 6 discrete tasks
2. ✅ Current state analysis documenting what exists
3. ✅ Clear description of what needs to be implemented
4. ✅ Success criteria defined

The status table correctly shows:
- **Task 1-3**: Create the authority.go handlers (Single, Search, area code mapping)
- **Task 4**: Add routes to router/routes.go
- **Task 5**: Add tests
- **Task 6**: Verify with Go tests

The existing Go code only has `/authority/:id/message` implemented - the main `/authority/:id` and `/authority?search=` endpoints still need to be added.

**INITIALIZER_COMPLETE**
