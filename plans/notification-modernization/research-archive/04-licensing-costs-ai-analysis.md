## AI-Enhanced Bandit Testing Architecture

### Proposed AI Integration:
```
User Trigger → AI Variant Generator → Bandit Algorithm → PostHog Analytics
     ↑                ↓                     ↓              ↓
Content Pool ← GPT-4 API ← Performance Data ← Real-time Metrics
```

### AI Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **Subject line generation**: GPT-4 creates 5-10 variants automatically
2. **Content optimization**: AI adjusts tone, length, and structure
3. **Send time prediction**: Machine learning determines optimal timing
4. **Personalization scaling**: AI customizes content for RFM segments
5. **Template evolution**: Continuous AI-driven design improvements

### Implementation Approach:
