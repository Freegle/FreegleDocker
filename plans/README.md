# Plans Directory

This directory contains Claude-generated plans and documentation for possible future implementation.

## Purpose

These documents represent comprehensive research and planning sessions conducted with Claude for various technical initiatives. They are:

- **Research-based**: Built from current best practices and 2024+ standards
- **Implementation-ready**: Include specific commands, configurations, and code examples
- **Future-focused**: Explore potential improvements and new technologies
- **Not currently implemented**: These are plans, not active systems

## Document Types

- **Architecture plans**: System design and technology migration strategies
- **Security implementations**: Authentication, encryption, and access control
- **Infrastructure configurations**: Server setup, networking, and deployment
- **Integration guides**: Connecting different systems and services

## Usage

These plans can serve as:
- Reference documentation for future projects
- Starting points for implementation discussions
- Technical research and feasibility studies
- Best practice examples and templates

## Note

While these plans are thoroughly researched and technically sound, they should be reviewed and adapted for specific implementation requirements, security policies, and operational constraints before being put into production.
